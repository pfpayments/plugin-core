/**
 * Opt-in cache-aside helper for gateways.
 *
 * Caching is entirely optional: {@see \PostFinanceCheckout\PluginCore\Sdk\SdkProvider::getCache()}
 * is nullable, and {@see remember()} degrades to a plain, uncached call when no
 * cache was configured. A client that never supplies a {@see CacheInterface} sees
 * no behavioral change; one that does gets cross-request caching for whatever a
 * gateway chooses to wrap in {@see remember()}.
 *
 * Generic by design: any gateway can adopt this by using the trait and picking
 * its own cache keys and default TTLs, rather than each cacheable entity growing
 * its own bespoke caching decorator.
 *
 * Composes {@see CacheControlTrait}, so {@see remember()} reads its current TTL
 * override and force-refresh state on its own — a call site never passes
 * either. A consuming class gets both traits' behavior from `use CacheAwareTrait;`
 * alone; it does not need to separately `use CacheControlTrait;` too.
 *
 * A broken cache degrades to an uncached call rather than failing the read: the
 * cache is a client-supplied, optional performance accelerator, not a dependency
 * the underlying data read should ever depend on for correctness. Any exception
 * thrown by the cache itself (a connection drop, a misconfigured backend, an
 * illegal key) is caught, logged at warning, and treated as a cache miss —
 * {@see remember()} still returns the freshly computed value, just without
 * caching it; {@see forget()} still returns normally. There is deliberately no
 * `CacheException` a caller needs to handle.
 *
 * Consuming classes must hold a `$sdkProvider` property (every SDK gateway in
 * this codebase already does, since it is also how they resolve SDK services)
 * and a `$logger` property of type {@see \PostFinanceCheckout\PluginCore\Log\LoggerInterface}
 * (every SDK gateway already has this too, via {@see \PostFinanceCheckout\PluginCore\Log\DomainLoggerTrait}).
