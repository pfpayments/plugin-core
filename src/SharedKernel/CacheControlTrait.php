 * knobs a caller can turn. The class using it is responsible for reading
 * {@see getCacheTtl()} / {@see isForceRefreshEnabled()} and forwarding them to
 * whatever it delegates the actual caching to underneath (typically a gateway
 * using {@see CacheAwareTrait}).
 *
 * Call {@see initializeCacheControl()} from the constructor, mirroring
 * {@see \PostFinanceCheckout\PluginCore\Log\DomainLoggerTrait::initializeLogger()}.
 * Any service that reads cacheable data can adopt this the same way, not just
 * {@see \PostFinanceCheckout\PluginCore\GlobalData\GlobalDataService}.
